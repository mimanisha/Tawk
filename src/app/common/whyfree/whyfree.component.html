            <h3 style="padding: 3%; text-align: center;">So, why offer a free product?</h3><br> 

            <h5>When we first launched in October of 2013, tawk.to would most certainly have been considered a late
                entrant.</h5> <br>

            <h5>The incumbents that came before us paved the way – though that didn’t scare us, as what was available in
                the market,
                simply didn’t fit our use-case, and more importantly, truly didn’t solve the problem(s) that businesses
                were actually facing. </h5> <br>

            <h5> We started this journey as unsatisfied live chat
                software customers subscribed to vendors that wouldn’t listen to our feedback.</h5> <br>

            <h4 class="bor"> “Never under estimate a late entrant - they get to start by learning from all of your
                mistakes.”</h4> <br>
            <h5>At the time, we figured that there were other companies out there 
                that felt the same way we did :</h5> <br> <br>
            <ul>
                <h5>
                    <li>that the SaaS pricing our competitors charged wasn’t attractive for many use-cases.</li>
                </h5> <br>
                <h5>
                    <li>that the reliability and accountability of vendors just wasn’t up to par for a tool as important
                        as communicating with customers.</li>
                </h5> <br>
                <h5>
                    <li>that there were so many beneficial features missing, as competitor apps were built around
                        revenue
                        models of “charging per seat”, as opposed to an agent-centric
                        model like tawk.to, which made more sense to us.</li>
                </h5> <br>
                <h5>
                    <li>that there were no multi-tenant chat applications in the market, that offered the ability to
                        manage
                        multiple separate
                        customer bases with one login.</li>
                </h5> <br>
                <h5>
                    <li>that the cost of paying for the software itself is not the biggest barrier for businesses to
                        offer
                        live chat as a channel, but instead it is the cost of staffing to
                        answer chats 24×7 that is so prohibitive.</li>
                </h5> <br>
                <h5>
                    <li>that just because there are hundreds of known competitors, it didn’t mean we had to target their
                        customers to gain market share, we could enter and help to grow
                        the size of the pie, not the size of our slice.</li>
                </h5> <br>
                <h5>
                    <li>that it was bizarre that when we visited the websites of many competitors , they were and still
                        are
                        – almost always offline. If you’re going to offer live chat as your core product,
                        and not use it yourself, there’s clearly a problem.</li>
                </h5>
            </ul>

            <h4 class="bor">"Don’t fool yourself into thinking your competitors know more than you do, opinions and
                ideas are like elbows - everyone has two. Do your research to gain some insight, back it up with your
                gut feel.. and most of all, be prepared to be patient..
                very.. patient. It takes a least a decade to
                 build an ‘overnight’ success."</h4>

                interact with
                a tawk.to widget each and every month — that’s 1
                 in every 3 people online.</h5>

                for them, and you can’t lose."</h4> <br>
            <h5>Very simple :</h5>
            <br>
            <h5>We made you, our customer, our partner – and we made it our mission and our purpose to bring you closer
                to your customers – to help you grow your business, and evolve with you on your entrepreneurial journey.
                <br>The thing is.. you made us who and what we are.
            </h5> <br>
            <h5>Your feedback, your ideas, your input, your patience and your loyalty — tawk.to has been molded and
                shaped, into what you wanted it to be. You are our maker.</h5><br>
            <h5>When your customers message you, you are tawk.to.</h5> <br>
            <h5>And to tawk.to, you are everything.</h5> <br>
            <h5>As a result, millions of forward-thinking business users now use tawk.to to get closer to their
                customers.</h5> <br>
            <h5>There was no way we were going to enter an incredibly competitive and crowded space, and just try and
                build a better mousetrap.
                That’s entrepreneurial suicide.</h5> <br>
            <h5>So we ignored our competitors, and focused on our customers – a strategy many would consider as ‘putting
                the blinders on’ – we call it
                the secret to our success</h5> <br>
            <h5>And believe me when I tell you, I know that sounds like hyperbole, though when simple things like just
                being available to help customers get the widget installed,
                became a massive differentiator we knew we were on to something.</h5> <br>
            <h5>As a result tawk.to offers 24×7–365 live support. We never close, you can always reach us.</h5> <br>

                business users completely for free, and still manage to keep our lights on?</h5> <br>

            <h4>Now.. there are probably three things you’re thinking :</h4> <br>
            <h3 style=" padding: 3%; text-align: center;">How can a 3rd party agent answer on behalf of my business?
                They don’t know my business. It would take forever for them to learn everything.</h3> <br>
            <h4>That is a very common misconception. Let’s do a quick exercise to illustrate:</h4><br>
            <h4>If I asked you:</h4> <br>
            <h3>How tall is the empire state building in New York?</h3> <br>
            <h5>You most probably can’t answer that question from memory.
                Though in about 5 seconds, you could provide me with a very accurate answer via Google.
            </h5> <br>
            <h5>See what you did there?</h5> <br>

            <h5 class="bor">An agent doesn’t need to remember every possible answer,
                they just need to know where to find the answer.</h5> <br>
            <h5>See, by the sheer nature of our business we simply had to invest heavily in building a chat
                system that focuses on the Agent Experience – as our entire business depends on our agents

            <h5>Which is why we truly believe, we have one of the best business messaging applications anywhere.
                In software development terms, that is called “eating your own dog food”.</h5> <br>
            <h5>By answering on behalf of different customers, of all shapes and sizes, we gain access and dive
                deep on many different use-cases that we really wouldn’t otherwise get exposure to.
                This has helped us to constantly iterate the software so that all of our free users benefit also.
                Which mind you, is 99% of all of our users.</h5> <br>
            <h5>We don’t sell chat software, we give the best, and most tried and tested software in a ‘real-world’,
                massive scale environment away completely free of charge.</h5> <br>

            <h3 style="padding: 3%; text-align: center;">The next question/comment/remark you may have is:</h3>
            <h3>Actually, it is. You just can’t see it – and that’s the magic.</h3> <br>
            <h3 class="bor">The most attractive businesses in the world, are the businesses that nobody
                else deems attractive.
                That’s what gets us excited.</h3> <br>
            <h5>Many SaaS providers attempt to build ‘hands off’, scalable software – and then they all
                inevitably focus on “Churn” ( the term the SaaS world uses to describe the
                difference between the % of users signing up to your service, versus leaving your service )</h5> <br>
            <h5>They then compete on features, and compete on price, to a race to the bottom.</h5> <br>
            <h5>We compete on value. And only on value.</h5> <br>
            <h5>We also believe that many business owners don’t actually want live chat software.
                What they actually want is more leads, more sales and to ensure their customers have a great CX.
                We know that statement is an incredibly bizzare thing to say,
                from the producer of the world’s most widely used chat application.</h5><br>
            <h5>Though that is the truth.</h5> <br>
            <h5>The world has changed, and consumer expectations have changed with it. We all expect
                businesses
                to respond to us as quickly as our friends and family do, and to be where we are,
                which is in messaging.</h5><br>
            <h5>Most business owners simply don’t have the bandwidth to sit there answering chats all
                day, so for those that do; we offer completely free chat software. And for those that
                don’t, we solve that problem for $1/hr.</h5> <br>
            <h5>Compare the following :</h5> <br>

            <h2>Model 1 - The traditional SaaS model</h2> <br>
            <h5>A subscription driven traditional Live Chat SaaS company that sells software for $40/seat/month.
                They sell you a subscription to the software, and compete with other SaaS companies on features.
                The more often they communicate with you, and provide you support, the lower their margins.</h5>
           <br>
                <h5>If they manage to sell you 1 seat, and keep you subscribed for 12 months, the LVC (Lifetime Value of a
                Customer) is $480.
                So they can’t afford to spend too much time with you over a 12 month period, or their model is
                unprofitable.</h5> <br>
            <h5>You then need to staff the chat, which if you intend to run 24×7 and you pay say $15/hr for a decent
                agent, it is going
                to cost you : $131,400/year just to have 1 agent available.</h5><br>


            <h2>Model 2 - The tawk.to model</h2> <br><br>
            <h5>A value-driven model like tawk.to where we give you our software away for free, and
                as a result have obtained mass adoption. Should you decide to subscribe to our hired
                chat agent service (zero pressure to do so),
                then we will train an agent for you on your business, and it will cost $1/hr.</h5> <br>
            <h5>So.. do you want to spend $131,400/year or $8736/year?
                And do you want to deal with a software provider that loses money if they speak to you too often,
                or do you want to
                deal with tawk.to where delivering world-class customer support is the core of our business?</h5>

            <h5 class="bor">“The media wants overnight successes (so they have someone to tear down). Ignore them.
                Ignore the early adopter critics that never have enough to play with. Ignore your investors
                that want proven tactics and predictable instant results. Listen instead to your real
                customers, to your vision and make something for the long haul. Because that's how
                long it's going to take.”<br>
                <p>Seth Godin, entrepreneur.</p>
            </h5> <br>

            <h5>I’ll go as far as to say that I’m available to give you some advice on how to go about it, this pie is
                big enough for everyone to eat – connect with me, I’d be most happy to have a chat with you. Don’t let
                competitors in a market place scare you.
                I’m an open book, we can all share ideas – and I may learn something from you.</h5> <br>
            <h5>Many entrepreneurs fear that a crowded market place means there is no room for new entrants and that
                unscalable business models aren’t worth pursuing; though tawk.to has proven the opposite to be true.
            </h5>
            <br>
            <h5>
                If everyone else is telling you your idea will not work, it isn’t scalable, or the model simply isn’t
                sexy. Ignore them. With careful planning; a solid strategy for growth and a tight USP you can compete as
                well as anyone else – regardless of when you decide to enter.
            </h5>
            <br>
            <h5>You need only look as far as Nokia? Kodak? Blackberry? and Yahoo? to recognize that just because a brand
                was market leader at one point in time, it doesn’t mean 2 girls/guys in a garage can’t build, launch &
