                NOTE: Limited availability – we limit the number of new customers this service is offered to, as
                providing customer service with a level of quality our customers have come to expect requires proper
                staffing and quality training. Humans don’t scale like software. If you would like to hire live chat
                agents to assist with your live chat answering, now is your opportunity. We receive way more requests
                for hired agents than we could ever hope to service, so please get in quickly to avoid disappointment.

                24×7-365 to assess the suitability of the Hired Agent service for your product or service offering and
