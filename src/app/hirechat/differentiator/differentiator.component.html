                <p>A messaging app offering hired chat agents. Strange, right? Not really.</p>
    
                   <p> Offering hired chat agents is core to our revenue model, and it is how we are able to offer our software
                    completely free to over 5,000,000+ (and growing) business users.
    
                    It’s what made tawk.to the #1 most widely used live chat app in the world.
                </p>
                <p>Currently we get paid to answer chats for a small group of awesome customers that do not want to (or
                    simply can’t) answer chats themselves.</p>
                <p>
                    To use our chat software will always be 100% completely free. You will never have to pay to use the core
                    application.

                    Your customers will think they are chatting with your in-house staff, right on your website.
